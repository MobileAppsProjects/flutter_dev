This folder contains all the features of the project. Each feature is a folder that contains the following files:

- `description.md`: A file that contains a description of the feature.
- `/controllers`: A folder that contains the feature's controller.
- `/models`: A folder that contains the feature's models.
- `/screens`: A folder that contains the feature's screens.

A feature can be composed of multiple screens, controllers, and models. The feature's controller is responsible for handling the feature's business logic, the feature's models are responsible for handling the feature's data, and the feature's screens are responsible for displaying the feature's UI.

Remember to keep the features as independent as possible, so they can be easily reused and tested. Also named the feature's folder with a descriptive name, so it's easy to understand what the feature does. For example, if the feature is a login screen, name the folder `login`. If the feature is a list of products, name the folder `products`. If the feature is a shopping cart, name the folder `cart`. And so on.
